# API-Client-for-StackOverflow

This is my first project for iOS using Swift.

This is simple mobile app that working with StackExchange API:

1) It shows table of questions from stackoverflow.com using one of several tags for iOS developer.
2) By clicking on some question you can see all answers for it including accepted answer marks and code fields.
3) User can change active tag by chosing one in sidebar menu.
